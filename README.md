## Game Rules
1. Objective:
Place as many of your pieces on the board as possible while blocking your opponent. The player with the fewest squares left unplaced wins.
2. Setup:
* The board is a 14x14 grid.
* Each player has 21 pieces of different shapes (like Tetris blocks), in their own color (e.g., black and white).
* The first player starts in the top-left corner, and the second player starts in the bottom-right corner.
3.	How to Play:
* Players take turns placing one piece at a time.
* Each new piece must touch at least one corner of your own previously placed pieces.
* Pieces cannot share edges with your own pieces but can touch edges of the opponentâ€™s pieces.
* Pieces must stay entirely within the board.
4.	Game End:
* The game ends when neither player can place a piece.
* Each player scores the total number of squares in their unplaced pieces. The lower score wins.
5.	Bonus:
If a player places all their pieces, they receive a bonus of -5 points.
